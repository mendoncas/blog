# Hi! 
My name is Ricardo, iÂ´m a devops engineer, programmer and computer science student.
On this blog, i intend to write about my experience with the different challenges that i face while working and new topics that i learn.  

I believe there is value in analyzing and discussing technical subjects through personal, 
experience-focused, lenses. This will dictate the content of my articles, and i hope you find them interesting!
