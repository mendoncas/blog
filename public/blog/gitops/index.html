  <p>Recently, we have migrated all of our services from a DC/OS Marathon cluster to an Openshift one. This was quite a big step for our organization, as we had to adapt to a completely new platform.
This included finding more modern and efficient ways to architect our CI/CD pipelines. As i researched the many different continuous delivery mechanisms that can be implemented,
i stumbled upon the pull-based pipelines and the GitOps paradigm, and it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>Here, i´m going to share my experience implementing the GitOps paradigm and using ArgoCD as the tool of choice for  continuous delivery.</p>
<h2 id="gitops-compared-to-the-traditional-approach">GitOps, compared to the traditional approach</h2>
<p>First, it is important see the difference and main advantages of GitOps compared to the traditional approach, the push-based pipelines.
Push-based pipelines, simply put, are pipelines that <em>push</em> to your deployment at the delivery step of your CI/CD. As an example,
a traditional pipeline that deploys to kubernetes might end with the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In contrast, a pull-based pipeline relies on a tool that <em>polls</em> a certain resource for the desired state and applies it to your cluster.
In our case, the tool of choice is ArgoCD, and the polled resource is a git repository. The practice of utilizing of a git repository as the single source of truth for deployment
configuration is what we call GitOps.
This guarantees a very important property: every deployment configuration of each application is subject to version control. This allows us to easily track, manage and,
if necessary, rollback to previous states.</p>
<h2 id="adoption-and-implementation">Adoption and implementation</h2>
<p>After setting up an ArgoCD proof of concept pipeline, i presented it to my colleagues. At first, the delivery step was counter-intuitive. However, my colleagues could see the value o
version-controlling our deployments and we collectively agreed that this approach would be the one. This was an important step, considering that DevOps is more about culture
than anything else, it is important to have the whole team on the same page.
Once our team decided to go with ArgoCD, we had to decide how to actually implement our new pipelines.</p>
